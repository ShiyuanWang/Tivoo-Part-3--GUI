Two to three cases from the consultation services are presented as unknowns. This format challenges those not currently on the clinical services in diagnosis and management. Representatives from clinical microbiology, radiology, and pathology attend. Much discussion ensues. This is a highly active teaching-learning exercise in clinical infectious diseases and adds a wealth of case material to the repertoire of all the Division members. The means of arriving at the correct diagnosis is stressed more than picking the right diagnosis itself. For more information, contact Michelle Harris at 919-684-6854.<br>Link : <br></p></body></html>
