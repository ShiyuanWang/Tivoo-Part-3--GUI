As we collectively and personally remember that day, a new exhibit in Perkins Library explores what it means to memorialize. From the large-scale memorial and skyscraper currently under construction at Ground Zero to more private tributes, there are many ways of remembering, whether national or personal, official or unofficial. "The Life of Memorials" examines the process of memorializing and the social contexts that surround remembering. "The Life of Memorials" is a project of Team Kenan, an initiative of the Kenan Institute for Ethics that seeks to bring attention to ethical issues in and around the Duke community through student-organized programming. "The Life of Memorials" will be on display in the Perkins Gallery through October 16.
