In some portraits, the subjects have little or no control over the way they are depicted; in others, the subjects become increasingly involved with the photographer. 
All of the artists reject a common tendency to view black communities in terms of conflict or stereotype. Includes includes studio portraitists (Malick Sidib¨¦, James VanDerZee), social documentarians (Milton Rogovin, J¨¹rgen Schadeberg), conceptual artists (Hank Willis Thomas, Carrie Mae Weems) and young contemporary artists whose work is largely unknown in this country (Zanele Muholi, Viviane Sassen).<br>Link : http://www.nasher.duke.edu/exhibitions_becoming<br></p></body></html>
