What can we learn about Durham from 2010 Census data? In what ways do Duke?s service-learning courses participate in Durham?s Downtown Revitalization Projects?

These are only a few of the questions faculty might consider when orienting students to Durham. 

At this hands-on and interactive workshop, participants will learn about actual and virtual resources on Durham through a Durham Library Guide; be connected to their subject librarian for further development of course-specific resources; and share ideas about ways to orient students to our community.
