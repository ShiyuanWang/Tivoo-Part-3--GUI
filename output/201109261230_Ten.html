This topic includes battlefield boundaries and drone warfare.  Professor Lewis is a former Navy Top Gun pilot and international law professor, and Professor Dunlap is a retired Air Force Major General in the JAG Corps, so their experience and knowledge of the topic is considerable. Please join us for a discussion of the evolution of the war that has defined our lifetimes. Chick-Fil-A will be served and there will be a generous time allotment for questions.
