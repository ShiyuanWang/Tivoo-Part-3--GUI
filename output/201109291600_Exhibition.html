The Nasher Museum presents a new exhibition, "The Deconstructive Impulse," showing that the role of women artists has long been undervalued in accounts of that work. The exhibition is a survey of leading women artists that examines the crucial feminist contribution to the development of deconstructivism in the 1970s and 1980s.<br>Link : http://www.nasher.duke.edu<br></p></body></html>
